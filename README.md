AWS project to build an image recognition pipeline in AWS, using two EC2 instances, S3, SQS, and Rekognition. \
Images are fetched from stored S3 Objects and image labelling is done using AWS Rekognition. AWS SQS service is used for communication between the two EC2 instances.

--EC2 Setup \
Click on "Services" -> "EC2" \
Click on "Launch Instances" \
Enter a name for the instance in the "Name and Tags" section \
Next select "Amazon Linux 2 Kernel 5.10 AMI 2.0.20220912.1 x86_64 HVM gp2" in the "Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)" section \
Select the "t2.micro type (Free tier eligible)" in the "Instance type" section \
In "Key pair (login)" section select "Create a new key pair" to create a new key for the first time. When creating the second instance select the existing key pair from the dropdown \
In "Network settings" section check "Create security group" to create a new security group. Check all 3 options which allow SSH, HTTPS and HTTP traffic. In the SSH option select "MyIP" from the dropdown \
Leave the default values for "Configure Storage" and "Advanced details" sections and click on "Launch Instance" button to create a new instance \
Similarly create another instance with the same key pair and security group \

--Run the following command in the terminal to set the correct permissions for the .pem file: \
chmod 400 key_pair.pem \

--Connecting to running EC2 instances \
Convert the key pair from .pem file to .ppk file using PuttyGen \
SSH to the instances using Putty to connect to the EC2 instances. Enter the address as ec2-user@<YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IPV4_ADDRESS> which is the "Public IPv4 DNS" attribute of either EC2 instance and load the .ppk file in the Connection->SSH->Auth \

--Installing Coretto on the EC2 instance \
Run the following commands to install Amazon Coretto \
$ sudo amazon-linux-extras enable corretto8 \
$ sudo yum clean metadata \
$ sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto \
After installation check using the below command to confirm Java is installed \
$ java -version \

--Accessing Credentials for Java SDK \
After starting you AWS Student Learner Lab, click on "AWS Details" and then click on AWS CLI to get the access key, secret key and session token which is to be stored in the credentials file \
\*\*Note: Accessing credentials is different for normal AWS accounts. \

--Copying Credentials to EC2 instances \
Create credentials file \
$ mkdir .aws \
$ touch .aws/credentials \
Vim and copy credentials to credentials file \
$ vi .aws/credentials \
\*\*Note: Crendentials change after a session expires. You would need to copy the new credentials again. \

--Creating SQS \
Click on "Services" -> "Simple Queue Service" \
Click on "Create Queue" \
Check "FIFO" \
Enter name for the queue \
Leave the other configurations to default and click on "Create Queue" \

--Creating jar files \
Clone the repository into your local machine \
$ git clone https://github.com/AyanNavalur/CarTextRecognition.git \
Create executable jar files for Car and Text recognition projects using Eclipse export option \

--Deploying jar files to EC2 instances \
You can copy the files using FTP command or FTP clients like WinSCP \
Place both the jar files in the respective EC2 instances \
Run the jar files \
$ java -jar jar_file.jar \
Output will be stored in a text file on the Text Recognition EC2 instance in output.txt file \

\*\*Note: All above instructions are for Windows OS. Few intructions might change for Linux/Mac systems.
